EDD store managers and admins can generate URLs for adding downloads to a customer's cart, applying a discount, and redirecting to any page.

You can select a product to add to a customer's cart (including a variation if variable pricing is enabled), a discount to apply and a page to redirect to. After configuring the URL, click "Generate URL" and a URL will be produced that does what you set it to.
